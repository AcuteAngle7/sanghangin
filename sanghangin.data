@ A Natural History of Sanghangin 
` type = chapter
` order = 0

_ What happens when you rewind the tape and re-run evolution? _
This is a natural history of [[Sanghangin]], a region where familiar life forms take an unfamiliar course. Its ecosystems are shaped by the meeting of distinct biological histories but unfolding under physical and biological constraints as our own world.
Nestled between the island continent []Amihan]] and the subcontinent []Habagat]], Sanghangin is an archipelago that forms a long-lived biogeographical transition zone. Here, biological communities that evolved apart now meet, overlap, and partially merge, producing assemblages that are strange yet familiar.
Today, Sanghangin is defined by shallow seas, fragmented islands, and strong seasonal patterns. Its present-day organisms, however, are the result of deep time. Continental separation, climatic shifts, ice ages, and shifts in planetary axial tilt have altered the region, redirecting evolutionary pathways without altering the underlying constraints.
The result is a living world of browsing flightless owls, horned panthers, toxic fruit-bearing trees, and brightly colored sauropods. These organisms may appear strange, but their forms, behaviors, and interactions arise from the same evolutionary processes that govern life on Earth.

The flora of northern Amihan have developed adaptations to deal with the extreme seasons of northern Amiham.Gice. Daigdig’s more extreme axial tilt, winters are long and dark so plants take full advantage of the growing season when they can. Scleroxylons like False Oak and ____ grow quickly during the spring and summer scarce phosphorus into their hard wood. 

Herbivores like Campobubonis niveus tend to prefer softer wooded Mollixyla. They also grow fast during the spring and summer but instead of investing in hardy wood structures, they store phosphorus in underground tubers. Plant like False Banana readily she's their herbaceous trunks during the winter, which are really just tightly packed leaves. Although softer, these plants are still fibrous so Campobubonis have developed tough beaks and strong jaw muscles and enlarged gizzards to process this plant material. They often browse at the forest edge where these plants with softer tissues grow. 

The Dilopholupus rubor is a predator that stalks these forest margins. Their cresta are extensiona of their sinuses which increase the olfactory surface areas and provide them an incredible sense of smell. when an individual picks up the scent of potential prey,blood rushes into these crests giving them a distinctive res color, which also signals to fellow pack mates. 

The Campobubonis is camouflaged white during the winter months to hide from such predators. The chicks have a mottled coloration to resemble fallen plant debris on the snowy forest floor. When threatened, the adult Campobubonis circle around their young and face outward, trying to fend off predators with their powerful beaks. Although they are flightless, they spread their wings for a threat display that makes them look much bigger. Feathers are arranged in a way to make it look like they have extra appendages. Because theirnfeahrers aren't needed for flight, they  an be arranged in unusual ways at the jointts of the wings to make the threat display look even more confusing and make it look like they have extra appendages.
